Group Members: Melvin Gitbumrungsin, Daniel Sirousbakht, Nich Rosen

Contributions: Each member got in a call and talked with each other to help write the code at the same time, so each group member contributed about equally.

Notes: The main method is found in the "MaxHeap" class rather than making a separate "Main" class. It is found after the fields and before the constructors.
